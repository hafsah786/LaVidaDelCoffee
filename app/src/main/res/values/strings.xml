    <string name="latteDescription">Latte is originated in Italy. It is prepared with a rich shot of espresso with steamed milk, topped with a thin layer of foamed milk. Latte is usually a morning coffee and Italians never drink it after 10 a.m because of the heavy portion of milk. The coffee content in latte is very diluted and it has a sweet, mellow flavor that can light up your day. Latte helps ward off depression and headaches, but high intake will give you significant calories because of the milk, sugar and syrup.</string>
